# NYCU_2023_Spring_Pattern_Recognition
## HW1
Implement linear regression using only NumPy and train your model using Gradient Descent by the provided dataset, and test the performance with testing data.
## HW2
Implement 1) logistic Regression and 2) Fisher’s Linear Discriminant by using only Numpy, then train your model on the provided dataset and finally evaluate the performance on testing data. Please train your logistic regression model using Gradient Descent, not the closed-form solution.
## HW3
Implement the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms using only NumPy. Afterward, you will need to train your model on the provided dataset and evaluate its performance on the validation data.
